# Motivating example

In this example, we'll use six different personality traits, each assessed by a few items/questions. Factor analysis will help us reduce these traits into a smaller number of underlying factors, which can explain the relationships between the items.

Letâ€™s consider a personality questionnaire designed to measure six traits:

- Openness
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism
- Emotional Stability

Each trait is measured by several items (questions). Our goal is to use factor analysis to see if these items cluster together in ways that reveal underlying factors.

# with no rotation.  Factor scores are not computed.
factanal(life, factors = 3, method ="mle", rotation="none")
```

## Factor scores

Recall that we have the following orthogonal factor model 
$$
\mathbf{X}_i = \mu + L F_i + \epsilon_i, i=1,\ldots, n,
$$
where $\mathbf{X}_i$ is the $i$-the observation with $p$ variables, $L$ is an $p\times m$ matrix, $F_i$ is the $m$-by-1 vector of factor scores for $i$-th observation. Each entry in $F_i$ corresponds to one of the common factors. 

Once the factor loading matrix $L$ is found using the methods introduced in class, we then need to find factor scores. 

There are three common ways to estimate factor scores:
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Weighted Least Squares (WLS)
- Regression method


# Compute factor scores with varimax rotation 
```{r}
# Compute variamx rotation (default)of factor loadings
#  Factor scores are also computed using the regression (default)
#  method
life_varimax <- factanal(life, factors = 3, method ="mle",
                    rotation="varimax", scores="regression")
life_varimax

# Print all of the loading values
print(loadings(life_varimax), cutoff = 1e-05)

names(life_varimax)
life_varimax$scores

```



# Plot the scores
```{r}
scores <- life_varimax$scores
plot(scores[,1], scores[,2], type = "n", xlab = "Factor 1",
        ylab = "Factor 2")
 text(scores[,1], scores[,2], abbreviate(rownames(life), 6),
      cex = 0.8)
 plot(scores[,1], scores[,3], type = "n", xlab = "Factor 1",
         ylab = "Factor 3")
 text(scores[,1], scores[,3], abbreviate(rownames(life), 6),
       cex = 0.8)
 plot(scores[,2], scores[,3], type = "n", xlab = "Factor 2",
        ylab = "Factor 3")
 text(scores[,2], scores[,3], abbreviate(rownames(life), 6),
      cex = 0.8)

```

# Perform factor analysis with 2 factors
```{r}
life_varimax2 <- factanal(life, factors = 2, method ="mle",
                    rotation="varimax", scores="regression")
life_varimax2
```


# Measure of sampling adequacy
```{r}
library(psych)
KMO(life)
alpha(life)
```

# Factor rotaton

Why do we need to perform rotation?
- Because we wish to find a rotation such that each of the $p$ variables has a **high loading on only one factor**  

Rotation methods: 
- Varimax
- Quartimax rotation
- PROMAX 

```{r}
library(GPArotation)
life_varimax <- factanal(life, factors = 3, method ="mle",
                   rotation="varimax", scores="regression")
print(life_varimax)
quartimax(life_varimax$loadings)
promax(life_varimax$loadings)

# Compute the matrix of correlations between factors.
 M <- promax(life_varimax$loadings, m=2)$rotmat
corfac <- solve(t(M) %*% M)
corfac
```
